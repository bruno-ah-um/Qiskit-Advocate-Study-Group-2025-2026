Here’s a **summary of the meeting** based on the transcript:

***

### ✅ **Meeting Overview**

*   **Date & Time:** 7 November 2025, 14:05 CET
*   **Topic:** Qiskit Advocate Study Group – Quantum Circuit Visualization & Conditional Logic
*   **Facilitators:** Thorsten Muhge, Wiktor Mazin
*   **Participants:** Multiple attendees (Bruno, Vito, Adi, Franz, Konstantin, etc.)

***

### 🔑 **Key Points Discussed**

#### **1. Recap of Previous Session**

*   Covered **single-qubit gates**, **Pauli gates**, and **Hadamard gate**.
*   Explained **bra-ket notation**, inner/outer products, and tensor products for multi-qubit systems.
*   Highlighted **exponential scaling** of matrix dimensions with qubit count (e.g., 2-qubit → 4×4 matrix, 3-qubit → 8×8).

#### **2. Why Quantum Computing?**

*   Classical computation becomes infeasible for large qubit systems due to matrix complexity.
*   Quantum computers handle these operations efficiently using quantum gates.

#### **3. Visualization of Quantum Circuits**

*   Demonstrated **Qiskit visualization tools**:
    *   `matplotlib` for circuit diagrams.
    *   **Barriers**: purely for readability, but may affect compilation.
*   Introduced **Bell states** and entanglement concepts.

#### **4. Conditional Logic & Dynamic Circuits**

*   Explained **if/else statements** in Qiskit for conditional gate application based on measurement outcomes.
*   **Dynamic circuits** allow real-time adaptation based on classical results.
*   Black dot = condition on `1`; white dot = condition on `0`.

#### **5. Visualization Techniques**

*   **Histograms** for measurement results.
*   **Bloch sphere** and **multi-vector plots** for qubit states.
*   **City plots** and **Q-sphere** for amplitude and phase visualization.
*   Emphasis on recognizing **Bell states** visually (important for exam questions).

#### **6. Exam Preparation Insights**

*   No code execution during exam; no paper allowed.
*   Questions focus on reasoning, not heavy calculations.
*   Example: Probability after applying `RY(π/2)` gate → 50% for |0⟩ and |1⟩.
*   Some matrix-based questions (e.g., identifying Pauli gates from matrices).

#### **7. Logistics & Resources**

*   GitHub repo contains all notebooks (today’s will be uploaded soon).
*   Mural board for session scheduling.
*   Next session: **21 November**, led by Franz.
*   Possible break in December; resume mid-January.

#### **8. Q\&A Highlights**

*   Discussion on IBM Quantum credits and hybrid circuits.
*   Suggested using **Qiskit Discord channels** for technical support.
*   Mentioned IBM contacts for advanced help.

***

### 📌 **Action Items**

*   Thorsten to upload today’s notebooks to GitHub.
*   Participants to review sample test questions and practice visualizations.
*   Adi to email Thorsten for potential IBM Quantum support connections.
*   Next meeting scheduled for **21 November**.
